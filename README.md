# Software-Technologies

This is a project that runs basic machine learning algorithms on datasets

## How to use
You need datasets of only numerical attributes in one of  the following file extensions: .csv, .xls, or .xlsx

You need python 3.12, and the following Python dependencies:
streamlit
seaborn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn

In the directory of App.py, run the command: streamlit run App.py, this should open a browser tab of the app.

You can also use the following Docker image instead:
Docker .tar link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LL394KHpx_UieJbwrSnyilOywONSuWwv/view?usp=sharing



## Algorithms
The App supports PCA, t-SNE, K-NN, RandomForest, K-Means, AffinityPropagation algorithms. It will print graphs and output variables.
